#	GeoWorld is a Sponge powered plugin that seeks to emulate realistic	#
#    geology as much as possible. Minecraft’s gameplay and exploration-	#
#    centric gameplay make geological models critical to player success.	#
#										#
#	There were some significant challenges to overcome while		#
#    making this plugin. The authors’ self-taught Java skills, along with	#
#    an incomplete understanding of the deep innards of Minecraft make 	#
#    efficiently generating geology difficult at best. In lieu of 		#
#    computationally-expensive process modeling, empirical models based	#
#    on the author’s personal experience were used. This approach allows	#
#    for optimizations based on integer math and parallel-processing.	#
#										#
#	That being said, these optimizations are a constant work-in-		#
#    progress as achieving a balance between gameplay, geological realism,	#
#    and computational resources is often difficult to achieve.		#
#    Check back on the Spongepowered.org forums for further updates to this	#
#    plugin.									#
#										#
#	Below you will find settings that will allow you to get the best	#
#    geology experience from this mod. Do note that these values were	#
#    chosen for a reason, and changing them may severely impact gameplay,	#
#    server performance, and object persistence in this world. Always back	#
#    up your saves before using new mods.					#
#										#
#	To begin using GeoWorld and any of its sub-modules, change field	#
#    “Use Mod” to ‘true’ (without quotes). You may also enable any sub	#
#    modules of GeoWorld by changing their fields to true. Note that some	#
#    modules like “Use Advanced Geology” will override lower modules like	#
#    “Use Custom Ores”. 							#
#										#
#	An attempt was made to explain what each field’s parameters mean 	#
#    both in the context of geology and in how they impact this plugin’s 	#
#    behavior below. If these instructions are still unclear please post	#
#    on the appropriate thread at Spongepowered.org forums.			#

#########################   OreVeins Module   ###############################
#############################################################################
#				How OreVeins Works:				#
#										#
#    OreVeins relies on three base geometrical features: 			#
#										#
#	* Sedimentary Deposits							#
#										#
#	* Complex Vein Systems							#
#										#
#	* Volcanic diatremes							#
#										#
#    Each of these features is controlled differently in the code and so 	#
#    you, the user, has different editing options for each system.		#
#    Again it is highly recommended to use the defaults set in this file,	#
#    but you have the option to change what you wish.			#
#										#
#####################     Sedimentary Deposits  #############################
#										#
#	These Ore Deposits are characterized by long, thin, undulating	#
#    sheets of ore. They may occur as single, isolated seams or as		#
#    a system of parallel sheets offset by some amount. 			#
#    They’re meant to emulate coal layers and Banded Iron Formations		#
#										#
#	enabled: you must set to ‘true’ in order to use that deposit for 	#
#	that particular ore. 							#
#										#
#	percent-per-chunk: The probability that a deposit will nucleate for #
#	any one chunk. you must put a leading zero on this number (i.e. 0.1)	#
#										#
#	max-percent-grade: The maximum percent (in decimal i.e. 70% = 0.7	#
#										#
#	min-percent-grade: The minimum percent grade to make a vein of this 	#
#	type									#
#										#
#	max-layers: Maximum amount of separate related formations to add.	#
#	Adding more than 6 makes things laggy.				#
#										#
#	min-layers: Minimum amount of separate related formations to add.	#
#	keep above 1.								#
#										#
#	max-width: Maximum x-z extent of the vein				#
#										#
#	min-width: Minimum x-z extend of the vein				#
#										#
#	fill-material: the block to place ‘filling’ the vein.		#
#	Setting to None will make veins appear faster, and will by default	#
#	fill them in with stone. However this also makes finding ores 	#
#	much more difficult.							#
#										#
#####################     Vein System Deposits  #############################
#										#
#	Vein deposits are characterized by long-branching sheets and dikes.	#
#    Each vein system spawns from a large but lowish-grade vein which has	#
#    many child veins. They’re meant to simulate hydrothermal alteration	#
#    that produces many ores of copper, gold, and gemstones.			#
#										#
#	enabled: you must set to ‘true’ in order to use that deposit for 	#
#	that particular ore. 							#
#										#
#	percent-per-chunk: The probability that a deposit will nucleate for #
#	any one chunk. you must put a leading zero on this number (i.e. 0.1)	#
#										#
#	max-percent-grade: The maximum percent (in decimal i.e. 70% = 0.7	#
#										#
#	min-percent-grade: The minimum percent grade to make a vein of this 	#
#	type									#
#										#
#	max-branching: Maximum amount that mother load veins branch.		#
#	Note that child veins will branch 1/2 as much as this value		#
#										#
#	min-branching: Minimum amount that mother load veins branch		#
#	Child veins will minimally branch at this value			#
#										#
#	max-strike: Longest a motherlode Vein can be. child veins are 1/2	#
# 	as long max.								#
#										#
#	min-strike: shortest both a motherlode and child veins are.		#	
#										#
#	max-width: Maximum cross-section of the vein. varies from 1/2 max	#
#	to max.	Child veins are 1/2 as big.					#
#										#
#	min-width: Minimum cross-section of the vein. Child veins are 1/2	#
#	this min.				 				#
#										#
#	fill-material: the block to place ‘filling’ the vein.		#
#	Setting to None will make veins appear faster, and will by default	#
#	fill them in with stone. However this also makes finding ores 	#
#	much more difficult.							#
#										#
#####################     Volcanic System Deposits  #########################
#										#
#	Volcanic deposits are characterized by an ice-cream cone shaped	#
#    feature called a diatreme. Diatremes form through explosive		#
#    decompression of volcanic gasses as magma reaches the surface.		#
#    The majority of gem-grade diamonds come from special diatremes called	#
#    Kimberlite pipes. 							#
#
#	enabled: you must set to ‘true’ in order to use that deposit for 	#
#	that particular ore. 							#
#										#
#	percent-per-chunk: The probability that a deposit will nucleate for #
#	any one chunk. you must put a leading zero on this number (i.e. 0.1)	#
#										#
#	max-percent-grade: The maximum percent (in decimal i.e. 70% = 0.7	#
#										#
#	min-percent-grade: The minimum percent grade to make a vein of this 	#
#	type									#
#										#
#	max-flute: Max change in pipe diameter as it gets close to 		#
#	the surface								#
#										#
#	min-flute: Min change in pipe diameter as it gets close to		#
#	the surface. Must be a value >=1					#
#										#
#	max-static-width: max-minimum width that the pipe can be.		#
#										#
#	min-static-width: min-minimum width that the pipe can be.		#
#										#
#	fill-material: the block to place ‘filling’ the vein.		#
#	Setting to None will make veins appear faster, and will by default	#
#	fill them in with stone. However this also makes finding ores 	#
#	much more difficult.							#

    # “Copper is found in association with many other metals and deposit

    # Sedimentary copper forms within ocean basins in sedimentary rocks. 
    # Generally this forms by brine from deeply buried sediments 
    # discharging into the deep sea, and precipitating copper and 
    # often lead and zinc sulfides directly onto the sea floor. This
